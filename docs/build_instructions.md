# Build Instructions
This assumes that the microscope is already fully configured, and that there is space to add a filter cube between the objective and the filter cube used for fluorescence microscopy illumination.

### Initial setup
* Add the second filter cube, with a 50:50 beamsplitter inside. (This will later be substituted with a 800nm longpass 
dichroic filter). 
* Position the 50:50 beamsplitter cube outside the filter cube. 

### Imaging part of the setup
  - The 50:50 beamsplitter we placed inside the microscope allows us to use brightfield illumination to correctly 
  position the tube lens for the small Basler camera. Essentially the first step is to make sure the same plane is imaged on both cameras.
  - Make sure the centre of both cameras aligns as well.
  - Leave enough space for the cylindrical lens and any filters you will need to place in the path.

### Illumination part of the setup
  - Swap the 50:50 beamsplitter in the filter cube with your dichroic of choice, and add the emission and excitation 
    filters.
  - Add the mirrors, lens, pinhole and LED.
  - Focus on your sample using your main camera.
  - Turn on the LED and move the pinhole until the pinhole is in focus on the image plane.
  - Now you can add the cylindrical lens and optimise its position. 

* Youâ€™re ready to acquire your calibration data and then use the autofocus!
