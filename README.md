# 🚨LED-Autofocus
LED-based autofocus built for the [Holden Lab](https://holdenlab.github.io/) Openframe microscope at the University of Warwick. Heavily inspired by [Rahmani _et al_ (2024)](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13331&id=548369) and [Lightley _et al_ (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.13219).

The repository includes scripts to run a GUI to monitor the focus position. The widget is meant to be run alongside a [pymmcore-plus](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/) instance in [napari-micromanager](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/napari-micromanager/).

The project is very much in the early stages so bugs are likely.

# ⚠️To-do
- [ ] Make sure code picks up current pymmcore-plus instance
- [ ] Calibration script
- [ ] `requirements.txt` to make sure all packages are installed
